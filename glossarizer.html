            <p>This is a list of words we use that might not immediately make sense to
              everyone. Jargon is annoying for anyone who doesn't understand it, but also
              serves the purpose of allowing us to communicate and co-operate efficiently.
              Just imagine having to use the description of a blockchain every time it might
              come up rather than the word itself. Yet at the same time, it makes sense to
              keep jargon to a minimum and the wizardy technologists in our midst promise
              (don't you?!) to refrain from using any terms that aren't listed here within the
              general fora and discussions. Thanks. Courtesy of the
              <a href="https://github.com/PebbleRoad/glossarizer">Glossarizer</a> team, the primary
              purpose of this glossary is to explain words and phrases as they crop up around
              our website. They are identified with a thin underline. Place your mouse over
              the word or phrase to reveal their definition. Of course, this page can also be
              referred to directly. The quickest way to see if we have the definition you're
              looking for is to use your browser's search facility (press Ctrl-F or Cmd-F and
              start typing). Test: Accessibility</p>

                  The cryptography community started to use these names (A, B and C) in the
                  1970s to explain their designs. Now the tech community uses the names more
                  widely for greater clarity than say user1, user2 and user3.

                  Intelligence exhibited by machines, typically developed for specific goals
                  such as reasoning, knowledge building, planning, learning, and understanding
                  spoken and written language. More ambitiously, a general AI may be applied
                  to any of these specific goals in the same way humans can adapt to different
                  goals.

                  Confirming the truth of some piece of data or information claimed to be
                  true. In the context of identity, authentication is the process of actually

                  Metrics related to human characteristics. Biometric authentication may allow
                  Alice to access her device with her fingerprint for example. Biometrics may
                  also help identify individuals under surveillance, for example with facial

                  Bitcoin is the world's first cryptocurrency. It is also the name of the
                  underlying system, the world's first application of blockchain technology.

                  A distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of
                  records, called blocks, secured with encryption from tampering and revision.
                  Before the blockchain we could have secure centralized databases and
                  insecure decentralized databases, and now we can have secure decentralized
                  databases. Bitcoin was the first application of a blockchain. The blockchain
                  is a form of distributed ledger.

                  Software for retrieving, presenting and making one's way around the World
                  Wide Web. Also known as a web browser. Examples include Mozilla Firefox,

                <dt>Browsing history</dt>
              
                <dd>
                  The list of the web pages a user has visited recently in a browser,
                  including the title of the web page and the date and time of the visit. This
                  facility allows the browser's back button to know where exactly to go back
                  to. The browser can apply a different color to hyperlinks on current web
                  pages indicating whether or not the user has been there before, and it
                  provides a searchable log to allow the user to find a web page they wish to
                  return to. Your browsing history is personal data.

                <dd>
                  Consensus decision-making is a group decision-making process in which group
                  members develop, and agree to support a decision in the best interest of the
                  whole. It represents a broadly acceptable resolution. In sociocracy, consent
                  is preferred to consensus.

                <dt>Consent</dt>
              
                <dd>
                  In data protection, consent means any freely given, specific, informed and
                  unambiguous indication of the data subject's wishes by which he or she
                  deliberately indicates agreement to the processing of personal data relating
                  to him or her. In sociocracy, consent is used instead of consensus for
                  decision-making.

                <dt>Cookies</dt>
              
                <dd>
                  A small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer
                  by the user's web browser. Cookies were designed to improve user experience
                  by remembering things from the last time the user visited the website so the
                  user wouldn't have to set them again. For example: a preference for the
                  French language version; remembering items that had previously been selected
                  for purchase; automatically logging the user back in. However, cookies were
                  very soon adopted for other reasons including the ability to track the
                  user's browsing history, a privacy concern and an early form of surveillance
                  capitalism.

                <dd>
                  A digital form of money where money is defined as a medium of exchange (used
                  in transactions), a unit of account (a measurement quantity), and a store of
                  value (allowing money earned today to be stored for tomorrow). As the name
                  implies, it relies on cryptography. Most everyday money is fiat money, which
                  means it's established by government regulation or law, whereas a
                  cryptocurrency does not depend on either.

                  The construction and analysis of methods that prevent anyone other than the
                  intended recipient(s) from reading private messages. The message may be
                  intended for humans (e.g. instant messaging) or machines (e.g. purchasing
                  something online). The stronger the cryptography, the more difficult it is
                  for a third party to break it.

                  Individual, separate, objective facts representing the properties of objects
                  and events. Computers work with data, but humans do not. Rather, we deal in
                  information; that is processed data, data made useful, data made relevant.

                  Unlike a centralized network, decentralized and distributed networks don't
                  have one central component through which everything passes. The economist
                  E.F. Schumacher associated decentralization with freedom and one of “the
                  truths revealed by nature's living processes." In other words, we don't find
                  centralized networks in Nature. See https://diglife.com/decentralization/

                  The European Parliament defines personal data as "any information relating
                  to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject'); an
                  identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or
                  indirectly, in particular by reference to an identifier such as a name, an
                  identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more
                  factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic,
                  cultural or social identity of that natural person."

                  acquire information about Alice, Bob shouldn't interfere with Alice's
                  actions, Bob shouldn't intrude into Alice's space, Bob should tolerate
                  Alice's beliefs, and Bob shouldn't appropriate, use, or exchange Alice's
                  property.
